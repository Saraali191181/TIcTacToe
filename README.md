Description of the game:
Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game that is played on a 3x3 grid.
The game is typically played by two players who take turns marking spaces on the grid with X's and O's.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, wins the game. 
If all the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has achieved three in a row, the game is a tie.
